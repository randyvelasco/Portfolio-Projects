Tokyo 2020 Olympic Data Analysis Project


Overview
Welcome to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Data Analysis project! In this portfolio project, we delve into the wealth of data generated during the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, leveraging a robust set of tools and technologies offered by Microsoft Azure. This project aims to showcase the capabilities of Azure Data Factory, Data Lake Gen 2, Synapse Analytics, and Azure Databricks for comprehensive data engineering and analysis tasks.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following main components:

Azure Data Factory (ADF):

Purpose: Ingesting and orchestrating the data flow.
Key Features: Pipelines for data movement and transformation, integration with various data sources.


Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2:

Purpose: Serving as a scalable and secure data lake.
Key Features: Hierarchical file system, access control, and integration with other Azure services.
Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL Data Warehouse):

Purpose: Providing a unified platform for big data and data warehousing.
Key Features: Parallel data processing, data warehousing capabilities, and integration with various analytics tools.
Azure Databricks:

Purpose: Enabling big data analytics and machine learning.
Key Features: Apache Spark-based platform, collaborative environment, and integration with popular programming languages.
