Enterprise Data Governance
By: Randy A. Velasco


Overview


For this project, I have compiled a dataset from a survey conducted within an organization. The survey was completed by employees, addressing various work-related challenges. Using OpenRefine, I performed data cleansing on the collected dataset, followed by analysis and visualization using Power BI. The survey includes several questions that require input from the employees.
